Automotive Antenna Design and Applications thoroughly examines traditional and new advanced automotive antennas, including the principles, designs, and techniques used to reduce antenna dimensions without significant degradation of communication quality. The contents of this book are based on cutting-edge data collected from numerous technical papers, patents, and patent applications. It presents an overview of many commercially available automotive antennas and covers features that have become standard in automotive applications, such as printed-on car glass antennas, reduced-size helical antennas, multiband compact, printed-on dielectric and patch designs in a single package. Includes simulation examples of antenna parameters that significantly speed up the design process using software packages such as FEKO, NEC, IE3D, and Genesys. Highlighting the practical aspects of antenna design, the authors present passive and active designs and describe the entire design process, including antenna simulation, prototype sample fabrication, and laboratory test measurements. The book also covers the production adjustments that can result from the demands of the real car environment. The presentation of numerous examples of passive and active automotive antennas greatly enhances this reference’s value to professionals, students, and anyone else working in the ever-evolving field of antenna design and application.

This book throws a lifeline to designers wading through mounds of antenna array patents looking for the most suitable systems for their projects. Drastically reducing the research time required to locate solutions to the latest challenges in automotive communications, it sorts and systematizes material on cutting-edge antenna arrays that feature multi-element communication systems with enormous potential for the automotive industry. These new systems promise to make driving safer and more efficient, opening up myriad applications, including vehicle-to-vehicle traffic that prevents collisions, automatic toll collection, vehicle location and fine-tuning for cruise control systems. This book's exhaustive coverage begins with currently deployed systems, frequency ranges and key parameters. It proceeds to examine system geometry, analog and digital beam steering technology (including “smart” beams formed in noisy environments), maximizing signal-to-noise ratios, miniaturization, and base station technology that facilitates in-car connectivity while on the move. An essential guide for technicians working in a fast-developing field, this new volume will be warmly welcomed as a powerful aid in their endeavors.

This book presents a collection of math problems for students of 12 years and older who wants to improve math level and to deep math understanding. Workbook is geared toward learning and developing math through practice. Around 400 math core and advanced problems are grouped into 8 categories: Geometry; Percentage and Finance; Bar and Pie Graphs; Logic; Linear and Circular Motion; Math in Physics; Probability and statistics; Work Word Problems. There are a lot of math examples, exercises, and tests are taken from different disciplines such, as physics, electronics, economics, etc. We would like to show through the exercises that math is not an abstract discipline, for most people math is an instrument which applies to everyday practice. School students will find here core and advanced word math exercises with real life applications. Practical math problems help to link math to other disciplines: science, social studies, etc. Book includes problems of varying degrees of difficulty. Drills are not very difficult, however almost each problem has some tricky key question. Students can find the detail solutions or simple answers at the end of the book. Answer explanations allow students to work alone if a tutor is not available. Children in the middle school or high school can use this book to work with year-round outside of classes. We envision this book as directed toward practicing teachers, as well as for tutors, mathematical circles, and college students. Exercises are based on different resources: English, Russian and some of them are original designed by the authors.
